Plans to further develop AI Recorder

End Goals

Have basically a text editor called Notes on right, where you can take notes.
Then build tree on left of notes automatically, highlighting as you go the text that is and is not parsed.
Allow search bar at top to search tree for terms.
Report results of search below.

In definitions or long text allow keyword input to connect them to their nodes or create them if non existent,
and allow them to show up in searches.

Also allow table building, so I can take one search (like for GDP), and aggregate it with another (like Population),
with common terms (like Country) and report it in one table like format for readability.


Will need title markings, and other markings for important nodes.
Parenthesis for equivalence.

Implement File saving and opening, without the use of the "common" SQL database.
